### M8: Hakuna Fermata
# Ethereal River

A peaceful, flowing song generated using Sonic Pi. 

The song features a soft, fluid background noise waving up and down. 
The main "instrument" used is a soft piano. Each note is light 
and effortless as the music cascades carrying the listener on a 
relaxing journey. 

There are five phases to this song. The first phase is upbeat
and begins with a crescendo of piano notes to uplift the listener.
It then continues with more piano that slowly moves up and down. 
The second part moves lower than the first phase and features a 
different piano that moves into a delicate rhythm. The third part
similarly features a soft background with simpler piano notes
that are not as heavy as the previous section. The fourth phase revisits
the piano of the first section to connect the song's end to the beginning.
Finally, all piano ends, and the listener is left with the gentle background
music as a soothing fifth phase to end the song and relax the listener at 
the end of the study session.
